# Testing Anti-Patterns

**Load this reference when:** writing or changing tests, adding mocks, or tempted to add test-only methods to production code.

## Overview

Tests must verify real behavior, not mock behavior. Mocks are a means to isolate, not the thing being tested.

**Core principle:** Test what the code does, not what the mocks do.

**Following strict TDD prevents these anti-patterns.**

## The Iron Laws

```
1. NEVER test mock behavior
2. NEVER add test-only methods to production classes
3. NEVER mock without understanding dependencies
```

## Anti-Pattern 1: Testing Mock Behavior

**The violation:**

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Testing that a stub marker appears in output
test("--version prints version", async ({ cli }) => {
  const result = await cli(["--version"]);
  expect(result.stdout).toContain("[STUB]");
});
```

**Why this is wrong:**

- You're verifying the stub/mock was invoked, not that the real behavior works
- Test passes when stub is present, fails when it's removed
- Tells you nothing about real behavior

**your human partner's correction:** "Are we testing the behavior of a mock?"

**The fix:**

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Test the real output
test("--version prints version", async ({ cli }) => {
  const result = await cli(["--version"]);
  expect(result.stdout.trim()).toBe(VERSION); // real value, not a stub marker
});
```

### Gate Function

```
BEFORE asserting on any mock/stub marker in output:
  Ask: "Am I testing real CLI behavior or just that the stub ran?"

  IF testing stub existence:
    STOP - Delete the assertion or remove the stub

  Test real behavior instead
```

## Anti-Pattern 2: Test-Only Methods in Production

**The violation:**

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: destroy() only used in tests
class Session {
  async destroy() {
    // Looks like production API!
    await this._workspaceManager?.destroyWorkspace(this.id);
    // ... cleanup
  }
}

// In tests
afterEach(() => session.destroy());
```

**Why this is wrong:**

- Production class polluted with test-only code
- Dangerous if accidentally called in production
- Violates YAGNI and separation of concerns
- Confuses object lifecycle with entity lifecycle

**The fix:**

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Test utilities handle test cleanup
// Session has no destroy() - it's stateless in production

// In test-utils/
export async function cleanupSession(session: Session) {
  const workspace = session.getWorkspaceInfo();
  if (workspace) {
    await workspaceManager.destroyWorkspace(workspace.id);
  }
}

// In tests
afterEach(() => cleanupSession(session));
```

### Gate Function

```
BEFORE adding any method to production class:
  Ask: "Is this only used by tests?"

  IF yes:
    STOP - Don't add it
    Put it in test utilities instead

  Ask: "Does this class own this resource's lifecycle?"

  IF no:
    STOP - Wrong class for this method
```

## Anti-Pattern 3: Mocking Without Understanding

**The violation:**

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Env var override hides a side-effect the test depends on
test("detects duplicate config entry", async ({ cli }) => {
  // Overriding CONFIG_PATH with a stub file prevents the real write
  // that the second call needs to detect the duplicate!
  const result1 = await cli(["add", "server"], { CONFIG_PATH: "/dev/null" });
  const result2 = await cli(["add", "server"], { CONFIG_PATH: "/dev/null" });
  expect(result2.exitCode).not.toBe(0); // never fails - config was never written
});
```

**Why this is wrong:**

- The env override nuked the side effect (config write) the test depended on
- Over-mocking "to be safe" breaks actual behavior
- Test passes for wrong reason or fails mysteriously

**The fix:**

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Point to a real temp file so the write actually happens
test("detects duplicate config entry", async ({ cli }) => {
  const configPath = await fs.mktemp("/tmp/domovoid-XXXXXX.json");
  try {
    const result1 = await cli(["add", "server"], { CONFIG_PATH: configPath });
    expect(result1.exitCode).toBe(0); // first add succeeds, config written

    const result2 = await cli(["add", "server"], { CONFIG_PATH: configPath });
    expect(result2.exitCode).not.toBe(0); // duplicate detected ✓
  } finally {
    await fs.unlink(configPath);
  }
});
```

### Gate Function

```
BEFORE mocking any method:
  STOP - Don't mock yet

  1. Ask: "What side effects does the real method have?"
  2. Ask: "Does this test depend on any of those side effects?"
  3. Ask: "Do I fully understand what this test needs?"

  IF depends on side effects:
    Mock at lower level (the actual slow/external operation)
    OR use test doubles that preserve necessary behavior
    NOT the high-level method the test depends on

  IF unsure what test depends on:
    Run test with real implementation FIRST
    Observe what actually needs to happen
    THEN add minimal mocking at the right level

  Red flags:
    - "I'll mock this to be safe"
    - "This might be slow, better mock it"
    - Mocking without understanding the dependency chain
```

## Anti-Pattern 4: Incomplete Mocks

**The violation:**

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Partial mock - only fields you think you need
const mockResponse = {
  status: "success",
  data: { userId: "123", name: "Alice" },
  // Missing: metadata that downstream code uses
};

// Later: breaks when code accesses response.metadata.requestId
```

**Why this is wrong:**

- **Partial mocks hide structural assumptions** - You only mocked fields you know about
- **Downstream code may depend on fields you didn't include** - Silent failures
- **Tests pass but integration fails** - Mock incomplete, real API complete
- **False confidence** - Test proves nothing about real behavior

**The Iron Rule:** Mock the COMPLETE data structure as it exists in reality, not just fields your immediate test uses.

**The fix:**

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Mirror real API completeness
const mockResponse = {
  status: "success",
  data: { userId: "123", name: "Alice" },
  metadata: { requestId: "req-789", timestamp: 1234567890 },
  // All fields real API returns
};
```

### Gate Function

```
BEFORE creating mock responses:
  Check: "What fields does the real API response contain?"

  Actions:
    1. Examine actual API response from docs/examples
    2. Include ALL fields system might consume downstream
    3. Verify mock matches real response schema completely

  Critical:
    If you're creating a mock, you must understand the ENTIRE structure
    Partial mocks fail silently when code depends on omitted fields

  If uncertain: Include all documented fields
```

## Anti-Pattern 5: Integration Tests as Afterthought

**The violation:**

```
✅ Implementation complete
❌ No tests written
"Ready for testing"
```

**Why this is wrong:**

- Testing is part of implementation, not optional follow-up
- TDD would have caught this
- Can't claim complete without tests

**The fix:**

```
TDD cycle:
1. Write failing test
2. Implement to pass
3. Refactor
4. THEN claim complete
```

## When Mocks Become Too Complex

**Warning signs:**

- Mock setup longer than test logic
- Mocking everything to make test pass
- Mocks missing methods real components have
- Test breaks when mock changes

**your human partner's question:** "Do we need to be using a mock here?"

**Consider:** Integration tests with real components often simpler than complex mocks

## TDD Prevents These Anti-Patterns

**Why TDD helps:**

1. **Write test first** → Forces you to think about what you're actually testing
2. **Watch it fail** → Confirms test tests real behavior, not mocks
3. **Minimal implementation** → No test-only methods creep in
4. **Real dependencies** → You see what the test actually needs before mocking

**If you're testing mock behavior, you violated TDD** - you added mocks without watching test fail against real code first.

## Quick Reference

| Anti-Pattern                    | Fix                                           |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Assert on mock elements         | Test real component or unmock it              |
| Test-only methods in production | Move to test utilities                        |
| Mock without understanding      | Understand dependencies first, mock minimally |
| Incomplete mocks                | Mirror real API completely                    |
| Tests as afterthought           | TDD - tests first                             |
| Over-complex mocks              | Consider integration tests                    |

## Red Flags

- Assertion checks for `*-mock` test IDs
- Methods only called in test files
- Mock setup is >50% of test
- Test fails when you remove mock
- Can't explain why mock is needed
- Mocking "just to be safe"

## The Bottom Line

**Mocks are tools to isolate, not things to test.**

If TDD reveals you're testing mock behavior, you've gone wrong.

Fix: Test real behavior or question why you're mocking at all.
